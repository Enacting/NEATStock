# NEATStock
Stock with NEAT and deteriorating bias algorithm for events (added specifically to the data). 


# Problems with this
This system is useful in some senses as a second opinion for whether to buy or sell a stock as well as how risky the investment is according to the spontaneity and unpredictability of the dataset, but cannot be trusted blindly.
The accuracy varies wildly with this system. At times the accuracy is below 50% and at some it is at 90% making huge profits in the simulation. 
I added a few extra algorithms such as a data-bias system based on current events for example certain stock market crashes due to coronavirus. 

# Future plans
Add a regression analysis algorithm to aid with risk analysis.
